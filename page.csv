Today we pause, we reflect and we reaffirm our faith as Americans in this great nation -- the greatest force for good the world has ever known.

On September 11th, we weren’t Republicans or Democrats; we weren’t rich or poor; we weren’t white or black or Hispanic – we were Americans.  No matter our politics, no matter our differences, that which divides us will never conquer that which unites us.

And so, as we mark this 13th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, let us remember the fallen and those they left behind.  Let us honor our heroes and the unmatchable courage they displayed.  And let us rededicate ourselves to the values we share as citizens of this great nation – indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.","2014-09-11T15:44:37+0000","status",NA,"213918568751224_462707350539010",421,31,46

One, the massive job-destroying 67% Quinn-Madigan tax increase that has robbed the average worker of more than $1,000 every year is rejected by a strong bipartisan majority.  At the same time, the politicians in charge of Springfield again refused to make the structural reforms needed to fix state government. Instead, they passed the same type of broken, dishonest budget that career politicians in Illinois have been passing for years. This phony budget is an unsurprising, yet tragic, conclusion to five years of failure under Pat Quinn.

Republican venture capitalist Bruce Rauner of suburban Chicago called it a campaign speech from a failing governor.

""We're one the worst-run states in America,"" he told reporters after the speech. ""We have entered an economic death spiral, and Gov. Quinn is trying to cover it up and put a rosy picture on it.""

""At some point it becomes less a matter of trying to steer an election and more a case of trying to hijack it.

It’s understandable unions are uneasy. They have been bruised by a few of the decisions made over pensions and other matters last year and are closely examining some candidates’ anti-union stances. It makes sense they would be selective about where to cast their support and the flurry of dollars that will follow such a pronouncement.

Resorting to schemes that undermine the opportunity of all voters to have an equal voice in the election process is over the line, though, and has potential to harm public sentiment toward unions more than any political candidate could.""","2014-01-28T16:41:24+0000","link","http://myjournalcourier.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=PE&date=20140128&category=news&lopenr=301289980&Ref=ARAt","213918568751224_10201520203902588",54,20,0

"230","213918568751224","Bruce Rauner","Well said Arthur, I strongly agree with this statement: 

“We must also clear up misconceptions. Free enterprise does not mean shredding the social safety net, but championing policies that truly help vulnerable people and build an economy that can sustain these commitments. It doesn’t mean reflexively cheering big business, but leveling the playing field so competition trumps cronyism. It doesn’t entail “anything goes” libertinism, but self-government and self-control. And it certainly doesn’t imply that unfettered greed is laudable or even acceptable.

Free enterprise gives the most people the best shot at earning their success and finding enduring happiness in their work. It creates more paths than any other system to use one’s abilities in creative and meaningful ways, from entrepreneurship to teaching to ministry to playing the French horn. This is hardly mere materialism, and it is much more than an economic alternative. Free enterprise is a moral imperative.”

"252","213918568751224","Bruce Rauner","My thoughts on the pension deal:

This Tuesday a group of Springfield insiders, many of whom caused the pension crisis with decades of bad deals and giveaways, will try to rush through a pension deal without giving Illinoisans an opportunity to study the details.

They want us to trust them.

We don’t – and can’t.

In the early 1990’s, Senate President John Cullerton was on a committee of 10 legislators who inserted language into a pension bill that allowed 23 government union bosses to collect an extra $56 million from municipal pension funds. According to the Chicago Tribune, “the changes became law with no public debate among state legislators, and, more importantly, no cost analysis.”

Sound familiar?

A few years ago, the legislature approved a workers compensation law that was highly touted for its bipartisan “reforms.” Despite the acclaim it received at the time, in the end it accomplished very little. Illinois’ workers compensation system remains uncompetitive with neighboring states and our economy continues to suffer.

This time the stakes are much higher.

Getting pension reform wrong could devastate Illinois’ economy over the long term.

The truth is the savings in this bill are both insufficient and will make true, comprehensive reform more difficult. Illinois right now has the highest unfunded pension liability in the country. This proposal would take us from the worst to merely very bad and guarantee a future of higher taxes. If you thought the Quinn-Madigan 67% income tax hike was bad, just imagine what tax-and-spend politicians have in mind for an encore.

Unfortunately, legislative leaders have kept Illinoisans in the dark about the details of this bill. The pension deal was announced on the afternoon before Thanksgiving prior to many legislators being briefed on it. Legislators will be asked to vote for it Tuesday. Yet as of this writing no one has released the legislative language.

Whenever politicians act like this, it is a bad sign for taxpayers. Like ObamaCare, they’ll pass the pension deal before most legislators know all that’s in it.

While the final details are unclear, summaries released to date raise some real concerns.

It’s rumored that the bill would eliminate pensions from collective bargaining alongside pay and health benefits. This could tie the hands of government leaders who will need to negotiate further, more comprehensive, reforms on pensions and related issues in the future.

We’ve also learned that the legislation gives “consideration” to government union members by decreasing the amount state workers need to contribute to the pension system. That means you – and everyone else - pay more.

The bill is also expected to include a ‘guarantee’ provision that could require taxpayers to pay for government pensions before payments are made for other government services and programs. That means payouts to government union bosses are ranked ahead of investments in our schools, public safety, and the social safety net. Provisions like the pension guarantee give government union bosses more power in a system that is already rigged in their favor. Government union bosses are funded by your tax dollars and use your money to elect and lobby politicians who will grow government and give them more money. It’s a closed loop system with taxpayers left standing on the outside.

The biggest problem of all is that the rumored savings from the bill would reduce the government’s unfunded liability by less than 20%! It barely scratches the surface of the problem. All this work for relatively small savings that do nothing to stop future tax hikes, and, in fact, make them more likely.

Bigger government. Higher taxes. That’s the future if we continue down this path.

There is a better way. 

Government workers and retirees deserve to be treated fairly.  But let’s not forget who pays for this -- it’s the hard working taxpayers of our state, who themselves are struggling to make ends meet in an economy that is weighed down by the fiscal blunders in Springfield. 

We can have a pension system that is fair to both sides of this transaction, the government workers and the taxpayers who pay for it.  True reform would cap the current system and fully put in place a 401k-style program that is similar to the retirement plans of most Illinoisans.  That’s fair to workers and taxpayers, and it ensures we will never face a pension crisis again.

Republican Leaders Jim Durkin and Christine Radogno are trying in good faith to negotiate a solution to the pension crisis.  Those good intentions are why Democratic bosses are trying to rush this through before there is a full airing of the facts.

We’ve seen what happens when a massive deal is negotiated behind closed doors, announced over a holiday weekend, and no one is given a chance to digest the bill.  It ends very badly.

A vote for this bill is a vote for insufficient reform. A vote for this bill is a vote for a future tax increase.

I'd call this is a blatant insult to every taxpayer, but it's clear Pat Quinn and the Democratic machine don't care about the taxpayers at all. In fact, there is now a pattern of Pat Quinn handing out taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits to key cogs in the Democratic machine. This is exactly why voters are eager for a governor who can't be intimidated or influenced by the special interests and political machines that try to control politics in Illinois.

""Bruce Rauner sees Decatur as the perfect example of how Illinois politics has let down residents — and how a city can rise again.

Rauner, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, took part in a town hall meeting Wednesday morning at Decatur Fence Co. as part of his statewide tour to raise awareness for his gubernatorial campaign and how Illinois can change through lowering taxes and cutting some red tape for businesses, growing jobs, creating transparent government and strengthening education and training.

'Decatur is a classic example of all the things wrong in Illinois: high unemployment, high taxes and deteriorating schools, and we have to turn that around in a very dramatic way,' Rauner said. 'As governor, we got to have regulations and taxes that are pro-business … and then I can travel to Indiana and Tennessee … and I can bring in companies and recruit them to come back to Decatur.

'I want to talk to them and tell them, ‘Look at Decatur. We have a trained work force, we have infrastructure and a great location. Come to Decatur and invest and build your business here.’ ”","2013-08-01T15:00:58+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/BruceRauner/photos/a.220336201442794.1073741825.213918568751224/284827458327001/?type=1&relevant_count=1","213918568751224_284827474993666",129,21,11
