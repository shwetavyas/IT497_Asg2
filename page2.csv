In honor of those who lost their lives on the beaches of Normandy and our surviving Illinois veterans who fought there, I proclaim today “Illinois D-Day Veterans Day.” This milestone is a sobering reminder of the high price we pay to safeguard liberty. We estimate there are fewer than 100 Illinois D-Day veterans still with us, and the horrors and triumph of that day are undoubtedly vivid to each one. I invite every Illinois resident to reflect on the valor shown by these heroes and all who landed in Normandy 70 years ago.",6/6/2014,status,NA,108650015336_10152553391225337,122,9,17
80,108650015336    ,Pat Quinn,"I was joined by the Laman and Bell families and the Associated Fire Fighters of Illinois in Normal to sign ""Lauren’s Law,"" which will require CPR and AED training for students in Illinois high schools. The bill was recommended by George Laman, whose daughter Lauren collapsed and died at her high school drill team practice in 2008. An AED was available at the school but was not used until the paramedics arrived 13 minutes after the initial emergency call. Mr. Laman, a paramedic, realized there was a need for training in CPR and AED usage in high schools across Illinois.

Eric Bell’s life was saved thanks to his son Harry who performed CPR on Eric until paramedics arrived. Harry learned CPR during health class at Fenwick High School in Oak Park. 

It is not often our high school students are faced with the opportunity to save a life. Should an emergency arise, we want our students ready to step in and take action. This common-sense law will make sure they are better prepared to help their classmates, teachers, family and friends in case of an emergency.

Over the past several years we have made so much progress to resolve our fiscal challenges, from cutting spending and overhauling our Medicaid program to enacting comprehensive pension reform. In March, I submitted a balanced budget plan that continued paying down the state's bills, protected education and public safety and secured Illinois’ long-term financial future. Instead, the General Assembly sent me an incomplete budget that does not pay down the bills but instead postpones the tough decisions. I will do my job.

167,108650015336    ,Pat Quinn,Today at the Capitol I was joined by hundreds of students and educators from across the state at the “MAP Matters Day Rally” to push to double MAP scholarships for students in need. A scholarship can make the difference in whether or not a deserving student can attend college. I commend all students and educators here today who are standing up for this great cause. An increase in MAP funding will help thousands of Illinois students attend college and prepare them for jobs in the 21st century economy. http://tinyurl.com/kw2ofy4,30/04/2014,photo,https://www.facebook.com/GovernorQuinn/photos/a.153944980336.132878.108650015336/10152471881800337/?type=1&relevant_count=1,108650015336_10152471883535337,53,12,13

211,108650015336    ,Pat Quinn,"Today marks the 67th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut at Ebbets Field. Jackie Robinson served his country in the U.S. Army during World War II and as an icon for equal rights throughout his life. He proved that working hard, perseverance and standing up for what you believe in are what count in life, and we must honor his legacy. Jackie believed that ‘life is not a spectator sport,’ and he lived his life with that in mind. He broke the color barrier in the major leagues, became the first black MVP and took his team to the World Series. At the same time, he fought for black athletes and Americans of all colors and creeds to be treated equally. This is why his number was retired by the MLB and why he received two of our nation’s highest honors – the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jackie Robinson is a true American hero.",15/04/2014,status,NA,108650015336_10152436846015337,76,12,14

546,108650015336    ,Pat Quinn,"Today’s action by members of the General Assembly was extremely disappointing.

Following a weekend of horrific violence in Chicago in which at least 70 people were shot and 12 killed, this was the wrong move for public safety in Illinois.

Members of the Illinois House could not even manage to pass follow-up legislation that included a few of the critical changes that I outlined last week, such as improved mental health reporting and the duty to immediately inform law enforcement officers of the possession of a loaded concealed weapon.

Throughout the legislative session, I made clear that any concealed carry law must have common-sense standards. I pushed for a ban on assault weapons, limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines and local option for home-rule communities, among other reasonable restrictions. I met with legislators regularly and discussed these standards in my State of the State address and all across the state of Illinois.

Yet, despite my objections, members of the General Assembly surrendered to the National Rifle Association in the waning days of session and passed a flawed bill that allows people to carry guns in establishments that serve alcohol, and allows people to carry unlimited guns and unlimited high-capacity ammunition magazines.

In a supreme overreach, this bill even included the National Rifle Association’s trademark provision – a ban on future assault weapon bans in home-rule communities – which has nothing to do with the concealed carry of handguns.

Public safety should never be compromised or negotiated away.

It was wrong on May 31 and it’s wrong today. 

We will keep fighting for these critical provisions that will save lives and establish a better, more responsible concealed carry law in Illinois.",9/7/2013,status,NA,108650015336_10151805480980337,109,217,24

Will two downgrades in one week be enough to convince the General Assembly that our pension crisis can't be ignored anymore?

Time and time again over the past two years, I have proposed, asked and pushed members of the General Assembly to send me a comprehensive pension reform bill. 

Time and time again, failure to act by deadlines has resulted in the bond rating agencies lowering our credit rating, which hurts our economy, wastes taxpayer money and shortchanges the education of our children.

Illinois taxpayers are paying a price of $17 million a day for the General Assembly’s lack of action on comprehensive pension reform.

In its downgrade statement, Moody's said this: 'An A3 rating, while very low for a U.S. state, is consistent with the General Assembly’s inability to steer the state from a path to fiscal distress.'

Legislators and their leaders know what they need to do to return Illinois to sound financial footing.

I’ve been in touch with the Senate President, the Speaker's office, and both Republican leaders today about this emergency.

Illinois lawmakers must take heed and act quickly in this Jan. 2 – 8 session to address our state’s own fiscal cliff. Every day that urgently needed action on pension reform is delayed, the problem gets worse. Our unfunded pension liability has reached $96 billion and without pension reform, it grows by $17 million every single day.

758,108650015336    ,Pat Quinn,"Today I joined Senate President John Cullerton (D-Chicago), state and local leaders and the Illinois Highway Safety Coalition (HSC) to announce our support for efforts to ensure that every Illinois motorist is properly licensed to drive. Because they do not have a driver’s license, an estimated 250,000 immigrant motorists are on Illinois roads today that have not passed a driving test. By removing this barrier through responsible legislation, to be introduced by President Cullerton in the coming weeks, Illinois roads will be safer and more immigrants will be able to become stronger contributors to the economy. Unlicensed drivers pose an enormous, yet preventable, safety risk for all Illinois drivers which leads to higher insurance costs for everyone. If half of the estimated 250,000 unlicensed immigrants became properly licensed and insured, Illinois insurance policy holders would save an estimated $46 million a year in premium payments.
